# data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes , data modeling and analytics
Data Warehouse Project

Overview
This project is designed to build a robust and scalable Data Warehouse (DWH) solution that consolidates data from multiple sources, transforms it into a structured format, and enables efficient querying and analysis. The Data Warehouse serves as a central repository for historical and current data, supporting business intelligence (BI), reporting, and data analytics.

The project includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data modeling, and integration with BI tools to provide actionable insights for decision-making.

Key Features
Data Integration: Consolidate data from various sources such as databases, APIs, flat files, and cloud services.

ETL Pipelines: Automated pipelines to extract, transform, and load data into the Data Warehouse.

Data Modeling: Implementation of star schema or snowflake schema for optimized querying.

Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data and scale with business needs.

Data Quality: Ensures data accuracy, consistency, and completeness through validation and cleansing processes.

BI Integration: Seamless integration with BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker for visualization and reporting.

Security: Role-based access control and encryption to protect sensitive data.

Technologies Used
Data Storage: Amazon Redshift / Google BigQuery / Snowflake (Cloud-based DWH)

Microsoft SQL Server

ETL Tools: Apache Airflow, Talend, Informatica, or custom Python scripts

Data Modeling: Star Schema, Snowflake Schema

Programming Languages: Python, SQL

BI Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or Metabase

Version Control:  Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

Cloud Services:  AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure

Getting Started
Prerequisites : 

Python 3.x

SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Cloud Data Warehouse (e.g., Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake)

ETL Tool (e.g., Apache Airflow, Talend)

BI Tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/CyberBillionAI/data-warehouse-project.git
cd data-warehouse-project
Install Python dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Data Warehouse (e.g., Redshift, BigQuery) and configure the connection details in the etl/config.py file.

Run the ETL pipeline:

bash
python etl/pipeline.py
Validate the data and ensure it is loaded correctly into the Data Warehouse.

Data Modeling
The Data Warehouse uses a star schema for optimal query performance. Key components include:

Fact Tables: Central tables containing measurable data (e.g., sales, transactions).

Dimension Tables: Descriptive tables linked to fact tables (e.g., customers, products, time).

Example Schema:


Fact_Sales
â”œâ”€â”€ sale_id (PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id (FK)
â”œâ”€â”€ product_id (FK)
â”œâ”€â”€ date_id (FK)
â”œâ”€â”€ quantity
â”œâ”€â”€ revenue

Dim_Customer
â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id (PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ name
â”œâ”€â”€ email
â”œâ”€â”€ location

Dim_Product
â”œâ”€â”€ product_id (PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ product_name
â”œâ”€â”€ category
â”œâ”€â”€ price

Dim_Date
â”œâ”€â”€ date_id (PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ date
â”œâ”€â”€ month
â”œâ”€â”€ year

ETL Process
Extract: Pull data from source systems (e.g., databases, APIs, CSV files).

Transform: Clean, validate, and structure the data for the Data Warehouse.

Load: Load the transformed data into the Data Warehouse.

Example ETL Pipeline:

python

# etl/pipeline.py
from extract import extract_data
from transform import transform_data
from load import load_data

def run_etl():
    # Step 1: Extract
    raw_data = extract_data()
    
    # Step 2: Transform
    transformed_data = transform_data(raw_data)
    
    # Step 3: Load
    load_data(transformed_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_etl()
